Every person that needs to move from a place to another one, develop a mental route to follow in order to reach the target place, however there is a lot of possible choices to take, and many considerations to keep in mind. 
It could seems like trivial choose the shortest route, however there are other issues to consider, such as how long this route can take, road conditions, hour, traffic and not less important, is this a safe route?. All this issues are take into account whether for people that want to move but also for people in charge of the roads maintenance, emergency teams, police and government entities. 
Every year the govermentd entities assign a budget for their different issues in charge, including the emergency services. For these reasons is relvant knowing more about the behaviour of accident on the roads, in order to define when could be useful having more emergency teams and equipments.
Therefore, we will study the car accident severity data wich will provide us information about accidents reported and their relevant variables that could make us understand better what conditions are more likely to trigger an accident, as well as when the events could happen, giving information to government entities about when and how much resources should to assign for emergency services.
